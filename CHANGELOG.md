  - Updated `default.nix` to work properly with callPackage using cargoLock
- **Performance Profiling**: Added `profile` target to Justfile for performance analysis
- **Comprehensive Test Data**: Added synthetic commit message datasets for testing (good, medium, bad examples)

### Changed
- **Improved Footer Classification**: Replaced overly broad regex pattern matching with explicit footer tag detection
- **Better List Handling**: Enhanced list parsing to maintain semantic grouping with introduction lines
- **Refined Document Structure**: Improved spacing logic between headlines, body chunks, and footers
- **Enhanced Unicode Support**: Better handling of Unicode characters in list markers and text measurement

### Fixed
- **Content Truncation Bug**: Fixed issue where lines like "EN: something broke" were incorrectly classified as footers

- Core text reflow functionality with configurable width (default: 72 characters)
- Support for preserving Git commit message structure (headline, body, footers)
- Unicode-aware text wrapping and width calculation
- List item detection and proper formatting
- Command-line interface with customizable options:
  - `--width`: Set body wrap width
  - `--headline-width`: Advisory headline width
  - `--no-ansi`: Strip ANSI color codes
- Nix package definition for easy installation
- Basic test suite and project structure
- MIT/Apache-2.0 dual licensing

### Dependencies
- clap 4.4+ for command-line argument parsing
