feat: add WiFi detection module and refactor network checks

- shell.nix: include networkmanager and wireless-tools for WiFi support
- hal/real.py: integrate WiFiDetector for robust WiFi connection checks
- hal/wifi_detector.py: new module for multi-method WiFi detection
- src/power_event_monitor.py: refactor is_wifi_connected to use WiFiDetector
- src/test_power_event_monitor.py: update tests to mock new WiFi detection

This refactor centralizes WiFi detection logic, improving reliability.
Impact: enhances network connectivity checks without altering existing behavior.
Gotchas: ensure all dependencies are installed for new tools in shell.nix.
