fix: resolve matplotlib legend warning in analytics chart generation

- Add conditional legend display in _plot_actions_chart method
- Only call ax.legend() when there are labeled artists (decision_times or action_times)
- Prevents "No artists with labels found" matplotlib UserWarning
- Maintains chart functionality while eliminating test warnings

Test Results:
âœ… All 25 analytics tests pass without warnings
âœ… All 148 total tests pass with 0 warnings
âœ… Chart generation works correctly with and without data
