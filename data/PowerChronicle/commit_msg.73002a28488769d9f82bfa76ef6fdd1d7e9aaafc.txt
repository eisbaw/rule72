refactor: modularize Justfile into aspect-specific sub-justfiles

- Split monolithic Justfile into 6 modular sub-justfiles in just/ directory:
  - just/lint.just: Comprehensive linting and code quality checks
  - just/test.just: Testing infrastructure and execution
  - just/format.just: Code formatting and style fixes
  - just/build.just: Build, packaging, and deployment
  - just/dev.just: Development utilities and workflows
  - just/security.just: Security scanning and vulnerability assessment

- Update main Justfile to import modules with clean interface
- Add comprehensive clean targets for each aspect (clean-lint, clean-test, etc.)
- Maintain backward compatibility with intuitive command structure
- Create .cursorrules file with modular justfile organization guidelines

Benefits:
- Single responsibility: Each module handles one development aspect
- Better maintainability: Changes isolated to relevant modules
- Cleaner interface: Main workflows clearly separated from implementation
- Comprehensive coverage: All development tasks properly categorized
