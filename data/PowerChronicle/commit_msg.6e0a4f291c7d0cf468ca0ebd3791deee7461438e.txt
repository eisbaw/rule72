fix: resolve all linter errors and warnings

- Remove unused imports across all Python files (F401 violations)
- Add comprehensive type annotations to fix mypy errors
- Fix exception handling to remove unused variables (F841)
- Fix file handle null-check for proper type safety
- Update pre-commit configuration to resolve types-all dependency issue
- Maintain only complexity warnings (C901) as acceptable technical debt

Linting results improved from 58 issues to 17 complexity warnings.
All critical errors (F401, F841, E722) resolved while preserving functionality.
