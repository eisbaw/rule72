feat: add devcycle task for comprehensive checks

- Justfile: new devcycle task for running checks
- includes Python syntax, type checking, Nix syntax, unit tests
- adds linting checks for Python and Nix files
- ensures all checks pass before development continues

Impact:
- automates verification of code quality and syntax
- reduces manual checking overhead during development

Gotchas:
- requires Python, Nix, and relevant tools installed
- may need adjustments for additional checks in the future

Flow:
- run `just devcycle` to execute all checks in sequence
- provides immediate feedback on code quality and errors
