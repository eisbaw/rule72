fix: resolve mypy type warnings in power_event_monitor.py

- add explicit type annotations for previous_state and threads
- type state dict explicitly as Dict[str, Any] in get_current_state
- add null check for log_file before opening in _write_event
- rewrite log_event to avoid **state unpacking confusion
- all mypy checks now pass with zero warnings
