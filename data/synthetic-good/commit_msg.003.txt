refactor(core): migrate event handling to async message queue

- Extract event processing from HTTP request path
- Implement RabbitMQ consumer with dead letter queue
- Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- Create event schema validation layer

Architecture changes:

- Introduces message persistence layer
- Adds failure recovery mechanisms

Performance impact:
- HTTP response time: 2.3s -> 180ms
- System throughput: 2x improvement
- Peak CPU load: 89% -> 45%

Breaking changes:
