feat: implement comprehensive NixOS integration and packaging

Complete Issue #005 - NixOS Integration and Packaging with modular
configuration structure, SystemD services, and deployment tools.

Components:
â€¢ Comprehensive NixOS module structure with main powerchronicle module
â€¢ Individual service modules for event-chronicle, policy-engine,
    action-executor, analytics
â€¢ Full SystemD service definitions with proper dependencies and security
â€¢ Package definitions with complete dependency management
â€¢ Command line utilities and management tools
â€¢ Desktop integration and visualization tools

Configuration Management:
â€¢ Flexible configuration options with sensible defaults
â€¢ Dry-run mode for safe testing and validation
â€¢ Component-based enables for modular deployment
â€¢ Power management integration and conflict resolution
â€¢ Security controls with minimal required permissions

Installation Examples:
â€¢ Minimal configuration (event monitoring only)
â€¢ Conservative configuration (full stack, dry-run mode)
â€¢ Production configuration (live actions enabled)
â€¢ Laptop-optimized configuration (aggressive power saving)

Features:

    powerchronicle-status)
â€¢ Log management and viewing tools (powerchronicle-logs, power-events,
    power-rules, power-actions)
â€¢ Analytics and reporting tools (power-analyze, power-visualize,
    power-report)
â€¢ Debug and diagnostic utilities for troubleshooting
â€¢ Automated log rotation and maintenance
â€¢ Desktop integration with .desktop files

Testing:
â€¢ Comprehensive integration tests for full deployment
â€¢ Service startup and configuration validation
â€¢ End-to-end functionality testing
â€¢ Performance and resource usage verification
â€¢ Security and permission validation

Documentation:
â€¢ Complete installation and configuration guide
â€¢ Configuration examples for different use cases
â€¢ Troubleshooting and diagnostic procedures
â€¢ Migration guides from other power managers
â€¢ Performance and security considerations
