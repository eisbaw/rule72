fix: add UTF-8 encoding to file operations in multiple modules

- Updated file open operations in power_action_executor.py,
  power_analytics.py, power_event_monitor.py, power_events.py,
  power_policy_engine.py, power_rules.py, and
  powerchronicle_status.py to use UTF-8 encoding
- Ensures proper handling of non-ASCII characters in log files
- No impact on build or runtime behavior
- Maintains existing functionality while enhancing text file
  compatibility
