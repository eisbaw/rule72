Complete HAL refactoring: implement DisplayHAL and ActivityHAL

- Create DisplayHAL for screen brightness, DPMS state, external monitor
  detection
- Create ActivityHAL for user idle time and input device activity
  monitoring
- Migrate all remaining legacy subprocess calls in
  power_event_monitor.py to HAL interfaces
- Add comprehensive unit tests for both new HAL implementations (24
  tests total)
- Fix return type consistency ensuring all methods return float where
  expected
- Update documentation with complete HAL architecture diagrams
- Convert pytest-style tests to unittest for compatibility
- All HAL tests passing: SystemdHAL (10/10), DisplayHAL (11/11),
  ActivityHAL (13/13)

Major architectural improvements: â€¢ Hardware abstraction completed for
display and activity subsystems â€¢ Clean separation of concerns with
proper fallback mechanisms â€¢ Security enhanced through SecureSubprocess
for all system calls â€¢ Mock implementations enable comprehensive testing
without hardware dependencies â€¢ Real implementations support both X11
and Wayland environments
