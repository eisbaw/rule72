Major architecture improvements: enterprise-grade patterns and practices

Implement comprehensive architectural enhancements focusing on
robustness, testability, and maintainability following enterprise
software patterns.

🔧 **Centralized Configuration Management** (src/config.py)
- Environment-aware configuration (development/testing/production)
- File-based JSON configuration with validation
- Environment variable overrides for runtime customization
- Type-safe configuration with dataclasses and comprehensive validation

🔄 **Circuit Breaker Pattern** (hal/circuit_breaker.py,
     hal/resilient_hal.py)
- Resilience against cascading HAL failures
- Three-state circuit breaker (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN)
- Automatic failure detection and self-healing recovery
- Fallback mechanisms for graceful degradation
- Thread-safe implementation with comprehensive statistics

🏥 **Health Monitoring System** (src/health_checks.py)
- HTTP health check endpoints for external monitoring
- Component-specific health checks (HAL, circuit breakers, filesystem)
- Overall system health status aggregation
- RESTful API on configurable port for integration

💉 **Dependency Injection Architecture**
     (src/improved_power_event_monitor.py)
- Injectable HAL dependencies for better testability
- Runtime HAL provider selection via configuration
- Component isolation for independent testing
- Backward-compatible with existing implementations

🔄 **Improved Separation of Concerns**
- EventCollector: Pure event detection logic
- EventLogger: File operations with rotation and error handling
- StateManager: State tracking and change detection coordination
- Monitor: Minimal orchestration with clear responsibilities

🧪 **Comprehensive Testing**
     (tests/unit/test_improved_architecture.py)
- 22 unit tests covering all new architectural components
- Configuration management testing with environment scenarios
- Circuit breaker behavior testing in all states
- Health check functionality and HAL integration testing
- Mock implementations enhanced to support new interfaces

Key Benefits:
• Enterprise-grade resilience with automatic failure handling
• Environment-specific configuration supporting dev through production
• Comprehensive observability with health checks and monitoring
• Improved testability through dependency injection patterns
• Better maintainability with focused component responsibilities
• Backward compatibility preserving existing functionality
