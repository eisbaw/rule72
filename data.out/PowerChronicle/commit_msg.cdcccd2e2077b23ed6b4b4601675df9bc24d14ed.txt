gitignore: add .pyc files to ignore list

- .gitignore: new file to exclude Python bytecode files
- prevents clutter from compiled Python files in the repository
- reduces unnecessary file tracking during development

Impact:
- cleaner repository with only source files tracked
- avoids confusion with generated artifacts

Gotchas:
- ensure .gitignore is updated for any new file types
- may require manual cleanup of existing .pyc files
