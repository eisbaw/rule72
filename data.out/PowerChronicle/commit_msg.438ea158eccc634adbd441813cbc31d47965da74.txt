build: add nix shell and just task runner

What:
- shell.nix: nix-shell with just + python deps
- Justfile: task automation (test, build, lint, etc)
- PRD.md: document development setup

Why:
- streamline development workflow
- consistent build/test commands across environments
- follows user preferences (nix-shell + just)

Impact:
- nix-shell provides all dev dependencies
- just test runs full test suite
- just build creates NixOS module

Gotchas:
- requires nix-shell for full functionality
- some just commands need systemd (status, tail)

Flow:
- enter nix-shell
- use just commands for all tasks
- shell.nix preferred over flake.nix per user rules
