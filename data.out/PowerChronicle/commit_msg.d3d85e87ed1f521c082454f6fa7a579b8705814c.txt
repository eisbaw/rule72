docs: fix documentation inaccuracies and implement missing CLI tools

Major documentation corrections and CLI implementation to ensure
accuracy:

## Documentation Fixes
- **PRD.md**: Corrected implementation status claims from false "100%
  complete" to realistic "~60% complete" with accurate component status
- **powerchronicle_handoff.md**: Fixed installation examples, corrected
  command syntax, updated service names to match actual implementation
- **Installation guide**: Fixed file paths, NixOS module imports, and
  configuration syntax

## CLI Implementation
- **power-events**: Complete event log management utility with status,
  tail, stats, timeline
- **power-rules**: Policy management interface with decisions, stats,
  rule listing
- **powerchronicle-status**: Comprehensive system status overview with
  health checks
- **NixOS integration**: Added all CLI commands to package installation

## Technical Improvements
- Fixed type annotation in power-event-monitor test to resolve mypy
  warnings
- Updated command examples throughout documentation to use correct
  syntax
- Added comprehensive help text and subcommands for all CLI tools

## Impact
- All documented CLI commands now work as described
- Installation instructions are accurate and tested
- Users get realistic expectations about system capabilities
- Clear roadmap provided for completing missing functionality

Current accurate status: Event monitoring ‚úÖ, Analytics ‚úÖ, Policy
Engine ‚ùå, Action Executor ‚ùå
