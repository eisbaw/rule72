refactor: split .cursorrules into modular .cursor/rules/*.mdc files

- Split monolithic .cursorrules into 5 focused rule files in
  .cursor/rules/:
  - justfile-organization.mdc: Modular justfile architecture guidelines
  - development-standards.mdc: Development workflow and quality
    standards
  - code-quality.mdc: Comprehensive linting, testing, and security
    standards
  - project-structure.mdc: PowerChronicle architecture and organization
  - ai-assistant-guidelines.mdc: Specific guidelines for AI assistants

- Add comprehensive README.md for navigation and quick reference
- Remove original monolithic .cursorrules file
- Maintain all original guidelines with better organization

Benefits:
- Focused content: Each file addresses specific aspects
- Better maintainability: Changes isolated to relevant areas
- Improved navigation: Clear categorization and indexing
- Enhanced readability: Shorter, more focused documents
- Modular updates: Easy to update specific guidelines
