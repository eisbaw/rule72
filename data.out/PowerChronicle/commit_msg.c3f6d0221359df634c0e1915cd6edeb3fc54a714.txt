feat: complete HAL abstraction for all system interfaces

Implement comprehensive Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) to eliminate
all direct subprocess calls from business logic, improving security,
testability, and maintainability.

New HAL interfaces:
- NotificationHAL: Desktop notifications and wall messages
- ServiceHAL: Systemd service status and configuration
- Extended SystemHAL: Inhibitors and session lock detection
- Extended NetworkHAL: WiFi enable/disable functionality

Refactored components:
- ActionExecutor: All system actions now use HAL interfaces
- PowerEventMonitor: System state collection via HAL
- StatusChecker: Service management through ServiceHAL

Security improvements:
- Extended secure subprocess whitelist for new commands
- All system interactions validated through HAL layer

Testing enhancements:
- Complete mock implementations for all new interfaces
- SimPy behavior models support extended functionality
- All HAL tests passing (13/13)
