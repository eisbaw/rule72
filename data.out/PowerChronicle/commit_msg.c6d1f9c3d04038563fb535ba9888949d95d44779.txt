test: fix HAL-based action executor tests and policy engine conditions

- update action executor tests to use mock HAL interface
- remove subprocess mocking in favor of HAL state verification
- check action counts, state changes via mock HAL methods
- implement missing condition checks in policy engine: -
  user_activity_recent: idle < 60s - network_active: placeholder
  returning False - session_locked: check state from event
- all 114 tests now pass with HAL architecture
