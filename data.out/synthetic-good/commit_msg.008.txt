feat(observability): implement OpenTelemetry tracing infrastructure

- Add OpenTelemetry SDK integration
- Configure Jaeger exporter
- Implement custom trace attributes
- Add service boundary spans

Monitoring improvements:
- Request tracing across services
- Error boundary detection
- Performance bottleneck analysis
- Resource utilization tracking

Metrics added:
- Request latency histograms
- Error rate tracking
- Resource saturation metrics
- Custom business KPIs

Storage impact:
- Trace retention: 7 days
- Storage rate: ~2GB/day
- Sampling rate: 10%

Configuration: terraform/monitoring/*
