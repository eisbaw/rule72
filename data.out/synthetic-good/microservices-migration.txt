refactor(arch): phase 1 of monolith to microservices migration

Initial phase of systematic decomposition of core monolith into
domain-driven microservices architecture. This commit represents 3
months of planning and 2 months of implementation work.

Architectural Changes:
- Extract user management domain into separate service
- Implement event-driven communication via Apache Kafka
- Add API gateway (Kong) with rate limiting and auth
- Deploy service mesh (Istio) for traffic management
- Implement distributed tracing with Jaeger

Service Boundaries:
1. User Service (Extracted):
   - User CRUD operations
   - Profile management
   - Preference handling
   - Auth delegation

   Size: 24k LoC -> 8k LoC (66% reduction)

2. Remaining Monolith:
   - Order processing
   - Inventory management
   - Payment processing
   - Reporting

   Size: 156k LoC (to be decomposed in future phases)

Infrastructure Changes:
- Kubernetes cluster setup (EKS)
- Service mesh configuration
- CI/CD pipeline updates
- Monitoring stack deployment
- Database sharding implementation

Performance Metrics:
- Overall latency: 850ms -> 320ms
- Resource utilization: -45%
- Deployment time: 45min -> 8min
- Recovery time: 15min -> 3min
- Request throughput: +300%

Data Migration:
- Implemented dual-write pattern
- Zero-downtime migration strategy
- Automatic data verification
- Rollback capabilities

Tables migrated:
- users (12M rows)
- profiles (8M rows)
- preferences (15M rows)
- auth_tokens (5M rows)

Monitoring & Observability:
1. Metrics Added:
   - Service-level indicators (SLIs)
   - Error budgets
   - Golden signals per service
   - Cross-service trace sampling

2. Dashboards Created:
   - Service health overview
   - Inter-service communication
   - Resource utilization
   - Error rates and patterns

Resilience Improvements:
- Circuit breakers implemented
- Retry policies configured
- Rate limiting per client
- Fallback mechanisms
- Chaos testing scenarios

Security Measures:
- Service-to-service authentication
- Network policies
- Secret management
- Security scanning
- Audit logging

Cost Impact:
- Infrastructure: +15% ($5k/month)
- Operational overhead: -25%
- Development velocity: +40%
- Incident response: -60%

Testing Strategy:
1. Unit Tests:
   - Coverage: 89%
   - 2,300+ new tests
   - Integration with CI/CD

2. Integration Tests:
   - Service contracts
   - API compatibility
   - Data consistency
   - Performance benchmarks

3. Load Tests:
   - Sustained load: 5k req/sec
   - Peak load: 15k req/sec
   - Recovery scenarios
   - Failover testing

Documentation:
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Service contracts
- API specifications
- Runbooks and playbooks
- Incident response procedures

Known Limitations:
- Eventual consistency in some queries
- Increased network overhead
- Higher operational complexity
- Learning curve for team

Future Phases:
1. Phase 2 (Q2 2024):
   - Extract order management
   - Implement CQRS pattern
   - Add event sourcing

2. Phase 3 (Q3 2024):
   - Extract inventory system
   - Implement distributed caching
   - Add BFF layer

3. Phase 4 (Q4 2024):
   - Extract payment processing
   - Implement saga pattern
   - Add API versioning
