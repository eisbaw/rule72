fix(security): comprehensive response to supply chain attack

Emergency security patches and infrastructure hardening in response to
discovered supply chain attack via compromised npm package
(CVE-2024-1234). Incident duration: 2024-01-15 03:45 UTC to 2024-01-17
15:30 UTC

Incident Summary:
- Compromised dependency: left-pad@2.1.0
- Attack vector: Post-install script in transitive dependency
- Impact: Potential credential exposure
- Affected systems: CI/CD pipeline, build artifacts
- Severity: Critical (CVSS 9.8)

Immediate Actions Taken:
1. Containment:
   - Isolated affected build agents
   - Revoked all CI/CD credentials
   - Blocked affected package versions
   - Implemented strict network policies

2. Investigation:
   - Full audit of build logs
   - Network traffic analysis
   - Container image scanning
   - Git history review
   - Dependency tree analysis

Security Patches Applied:
1. Dependencies:
   - Removed compromised package
   - Updated 45 dependencies
   - Implemented strict version pinning
   - Added integrity checks

2. Infrastructure:
   - Rotated all secrets and credentials
   - Updated base container images
   - Hardened build pipeline
   - Enhanced network isolation

3. Access Control:
   - Implemented new RBAC policies
   - Enhanced audit logging
   - Added MFA requirements
   - Restricted privileged access

System Hardening:
1. Build Pipeline:
   - Isolated build environments
   - Read-only container roots
   - Strict resource limits
   - Network allow-listing

2. Runtime Environment:
   - Updated security policies
   - Enhanced container scanning
   - Added integrity verification
   - Implemented drift detection

3. Monitoring:
   - Added behavioral analytics
   - Enhanced audit logging
   - Implemented FIM
   - Added network IDS

Prevention Measures:
1. Package Management:
   - Private npm registry
   - Dependency verification
   - License compliance checks
   - Security scanning

2. CI/CD Security:
   - Ephemeral credentials
   - Isolated build stages
   - Artifact signing
   - Supply chain verification

3. Access Controls:
   - Just-in-time access
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Regular access reviews
   - Privilege escalation alerts

Affected Systems:
- Build pipeline: 15 agents
- Artifacts: 230 containers
- Applications: 12 services
- Environments: dev, staging

Recovery Actions:
1. Credential Rotation:
   - API keys: 45 rotated
   - Service accounts: 12 updated
   - SSH keys: 25 replaced
   - Certificates: 8 reissued

2. System Cleanup:
   - Rebuilt all containers
   - Redeployed services
   - Purged caches
   - Updated DNS records

3. Verification:
   - Security scanning
   - Penetration testing
   - Compliance audit
   - Third-party review

Monitoring Enhancements:
1. New Alert Rules:
   - Suspicious build patterns
   - Unusual network activity
   - Resource consumption
   - Access anomalies

2. Metrics Added:
   - Package integrity checks
   - Build environment stats
   - Access patterns
   - Resource utilization

Documentation Updates:
- Incident response playbook
- Security guidelines
- Build documentation
- Recovery procedures

Testing & Validation:
- Security scanning results
- Penetration test report
- Compliance verification
- Performance impact analysis

Lessons Learned:
1. Technical:
   - Enhanced dependency validation
   - Improved isolation measures
   - Better monitoring coverage
   - Automated response procedures

2. Process:
   - Updated security reviews
   - Enhanced change control
   - Improved communication
   - Better documentation

Future Improvements:
1. Short-term (1 month):
   - Enhanced monitoring
   - Automated scanning
   - Training updates
   - Policy refinement

2. Long-term (6 months):
   - Zero-trust architecture
   - Enhanced supply chain security
   - Automated response systems
   - Regular security exercises
